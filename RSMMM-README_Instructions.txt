Description: 

RSMMM adds several stockalike music tracks by Kevin MacLeod and ambient sounds from freesound.org in order to further enhance and add a bit of groovy grooves to your Kerbal Space Program experience. All tracks are instrumental, some are whimsical, some are loungy...all approved by the Kerbin Instrumental Sound Society (aka KISS - not to be confused with the Earthling band).
   
Blues, Reggae/Dub, Funk, Jazz, Disco, R&B, Soul, World, Classic Guitar, Latin/Brazilian, Mellow Rock, Loungy Stand up Bass Types, Groovy Space Rock, Futuristic Modern Spacey Stuff, Chilling in Space Ambiances, 1960s Star Trek TV Series Sound-alikes, and a splash of Austin Powers-ish cut scene music to keep your Kerbals (or you) from going daft on long missions.

Please see Licenses/RSMMM-Licenses.txt included with this mod for a full listing of included tracks.

==============================================================
Installation:

1. You need to have Soundtrack Editor already installed in your root KSP folder as per instructions for that awesome mod.
2. Extract the entire contents of this zip to the KSP root folder, merging the Licenses, Music, and Playlists folders with the existing folders. PLEASE NOTE: This music add-on mod will not overwrite anything in the Music folder unless you have installed the contained music and/or sound files previously.  A listing of all music/sounds included in this mod can be found in Licenses/RSMMM-Licenses.txt.
3. Open the Playlists folder, make a backup/rename your current playlists.cfg file and rename RS playlist.cfg to playlist.cfg.
4. Launch KSP and enjoy the new instrumental and ambient bliss!

==============================================================
Adding custom music files (per instructions from Soundtrack Editor):

Drop any new .wav, .ogg or .mp3 files you want to use into the Music folder, next to KSP.exe. These will be available to use in Soundtrack Editor playlists. You can create as many sub folders here as you want to organize the tracks.

==============================================================
Opening Soundtrack Editor (per instructions from Soundtrack Editor):

Start up KSP and go to the KSC or flight menu. Click on the music speaker icon in the application launcher to open the Soundtrack Editor.

==============================================================
Uninstallation:

1. Delete RSMMM-Licenses.txt from the Licenses folder.
2. Delete the RSMusic folder from the Music folder.
3. Delete playlist.cfg from the Playlists folder (and rename your original playlist to playlist.cfg...basically the reverse of Installation step #3 above). 
4. Delete RSMMM-Readme_Instructions.txt in the KSP root folder.
