Description: 

   RSMMM is a mod/add-on to Soundtrack Editor that adds stockalike music and ambient sounds in order to further enhance and add a bit of groove to your Kerbal Space Program experience. All tracks are instrumental, some are whimsical, some are loungy...all approved by the Kerbin Instrumental Sound Society (KISS).
   
   Reggae/Dub, Funk, Jazz, Disco, World, Classic Guitar, Latin/Brazilian, Blues, Mellow Rock, Loungy Stand up Bass Types, Groovy Space Rock, Futuristic Modern Spacey Stuff, Chilling in Space Ambiances, 1960s Star Trek TV Series sound-alikes, and a splash of Austin Powers-ish cutscene music to keep your Kerbals (or you) from going daft on long missions.

   Please see Licenses/RSMMM-Licenses.txt included with this mod for a full listing of included tracks.

==============================================================
Installation:

   1. You need to have Soundtrack Editor already installed in your root KSP folder as per instructions for that mod.

   2. Extract the entire contents of this zip to the KSP root folder, merging the Licenses, Music, and Playlists folders with the existing folders (RSMMM will not overwrite anything in these  folders unless you have installed an earlier version of this mod).

   3. Open the Playlists folder, make a backup/rename your current playlists.cfg file and rename RS playlist.cfg* to playlist.cfg.
	
    	* NOTE: RS playlists.cfg is a 'Read Only' file. REASON: There is a minor bug in Soundtrack Editor that changes 'vesselState' to 'vesselSituation' when you save changes via the in game editor (affected playlists will not work correctly the next time you fire up KSP). Feel free to manually edit the playlists file but remember to make it 'Read Only' again or you will get musical 'surprises' in flight scenes. ;)
	
   4. Launch KSP and enjoy the new instrumental and ambient tracks!
	
==============================================================
Adding custom music files (per instructions from Soundtrack Editor): 

   Drop any new .wav, .ogg or .mp3 files you want to use into the Music folder, next to KSP.exe. These will be available to use in Soundtrack Editor playlists. You can create as many sub folders here as you want to organize the tracks.

==============================================================
Opening Soundtrack Editor (per instructions from Soundtrack Editor): 

   Start up KSP and go to the KSC or flight menu. Click on the music speaker icon in the application launcher to open the Soundtrack Editor.

==============================================================
Uninstallation:

   1. Delete RSMMM-Licenses.txt from the Licenses folder.
   2. Delete the RSMusic folder from the Music folder.
   3. Delete playlist.cfg from the Playlists folder (and rename your original playlist to playlist.cfg...basically the reverse of Installation step #3 above). 
   4. Delete RSMMM-Readme_Instructions.txt in the KSP root folder.
